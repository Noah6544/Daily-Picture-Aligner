## First Commit
Completed
- File managment, gathering pictures from a given directory and taking all photos from it that aren't curropted (0 bytes in size). Opencv2 can display all of the pictures without any alignment, just raw pictures (not raw as in file type).
- Essentially it's a picture slide player that slides pictures at the speed you want
## Second Commit
